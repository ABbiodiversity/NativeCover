# Summary

Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP), in partnership with the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI), has developed an indicator to track the percentage of native cover in both terrestrial (i.e., upland) and aquatic (i.e., bogs, fens, swamps, marsh, open water) habitats.

## Acknowledgement
