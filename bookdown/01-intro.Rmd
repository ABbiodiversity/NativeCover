# Introduction

The conservation and restoration of biodiversity is a global priority (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological
Diversity, 2020), with the recent adoption of targets and goals through the 2022 Kunming-Montreal Global
Biodiversity Framework (GBF) representing a global commitment to reverse the decline in biodiversity. Habitat loss is considered to be the primary cause of the global decline in biodiversity in recent decades (Millennium Ecosystem
Assessment, 2005; Newbold et al., 2015; Semper-Pascual et al., 2021). The availability of high-quality habitat has
been linked to species richness, species resilience and biodiversity (Rosenzweig, 1995; Klok and De Roos, 1998;
Wilson et al., 2002; Ribic et al., 2009; Ramesh et al., 2016). Conversely, replacing native habitat (‘native cover’) with anthropogenic land uses (‘human footprints’) has been shown to reduce biodiversity (Vitousek et al., 1997; Crooks and Soulé, 1999; Laurance and Cochrane, 2001; Sanderson et al., 2002). A key aspect of the GBF is tracking
progress of the targets and goals through the development and monitoring of indicators. Alberta Environment and
Protected Areas, in partnership with the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI), developed the Native Cover indicator to support biodiversity conservation and land-use management. ‘Native cover’ is defined as an area that is free of visible anthropogenic alteration (human footprint). ‘Human footprint’ is any area visibly altered for anthropogenic land use. The Native Cover indicator quantifies one facet of biodiversity loss by tracking the amount of native cover converted to human footprints, typically for settlement, agriculture, resource extraction, and transportation.
