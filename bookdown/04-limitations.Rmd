# Limitations and Future Improvements

All indicators, as representations of a component of the environment, have limitations. A single indicator cannot
measure all aspects of habitat quantity and quality. The Native Cover indicator is intended to serve as a general
indicator of habitat quantity at the regional and sub-regional levels.

Currently, clearcut harvest areas are the only type of footprint that is allowed to recover in the calculation of AWNC
and TNC. Recovery for other footprint types (e.g., seismic lines, wellpads) will not be accounted for until sufficient
supporting information becomes available. 

Potential future improvements include:
• incorporating recovery for other human footprint types and refining the recovery curves for forest harvest areas,
• attributing changes in AWNC and TNC to relevant reporting sectors, and
• acquiring new wetland inventories that better represent wetland loss over time.
