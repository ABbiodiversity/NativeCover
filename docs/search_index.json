The Native Cover indicator quantifies one facet of biodiversity loss by tracking the amount of native cover converted to human footprints, typically for settlement, agriculture, resource extraction, and transportation. There are two types of native cover: - Aquatic and wetland native cover (AWNC), representing the amount of aquatic habitat free of visible human footprint, including bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, open water, and riparian areas; - Terrestrial native cover (TNC), representing the amount of upland (non-aquatic) habitat free of visible human footprint. 1.1 Supporting Information This repository contains the R code (src/) required for reproducing the results presented on . The Native Cover Indicator for Alberta is a geospatial product that presents the status of AWNC and TNC for all HUC 8 watersheds in Alberta at five timesteps: 2010, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. This data layer can be found on the Government of Alberta’s GeoDiscover Alberta platform. Technical documentation describing the methodology and underlying data layers for this indicator can also be found on GeoDiscover Alberta. 1.2 Acknowledgement We would like to acknowledge that this work would not be possible without the dedication of staff from both the Government of Alberta and ABMI. 1.3 Suggested citation Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute. 2024.

The conservation and restoration of biodiversity is a global priority Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (2020), with the recent adoption of targets and goals through the 2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) representing a global commitment to reverse the decline in biodiversity. Habitat loss is considered to be the primary cause of the global decline in biodiversity in recent decades (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005; Newbold 2015; Semper-Pascual 2021). The availability of high-quality habitat has been linked to species richness, species resilience and biodiversity (Rosenzweig 1995; Klok 1998; Wilson 2002; Ribic 2009; Ramesh 2016). Conversely, replacing native habitat (‘native cover’) with anthropogenic land uses (‘human footprints’) has been shown to reduce biodiversity (Vitousek 1997; Crooks 1997; Laurance 2001; Sanderson 2001). A key aspect of the GBF is tracking progress of the targets and goals through the development and monitoring of indicators. Alberta Environment and Protected Areas, in partnership with the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI), developed the Native Cover indicator to support biodiversity conservation and land-use management. ‘Native cover’ is defined as an area that is free of visible anthropogenic alteration (human footprint). ‘Human footprint’ is any area visibly altered for anthropogenic land use. The Native Cover indicator quantifies one facet of biodiversity loss by tracking the amount of native cover converted to human footprints, typically for settlement, agriculture, resource extraction, and transportation. 2.2 How can it be measured? This indicator measures two types of native cover: Aquatic native cover represents the amount of aquatic habitat including bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, open water, and riparian areas. Terrestrial native cover represents the amount of habitat not identified as aquatic habitat (i.e., upland). For each indicator, we delineated the areas of aquatic and terrestrial native cover and then overlaid human footprint to assess the current condition, while discounting for harvest area recovery. The reference condition was assessed as the total area of aquatic and terrestrial native cover without the presence of human footprint. This indicator is then presented as the percentage of current native cover (i.e., with footprint) relative to the reference state (i.e., without footprint).

This inventory was developed using open access Sentinal-1 and -2 data and machine learning algorithms (DeLancey et al. 2019, 2020). Due to differences in the types of wetland distributed across Alberta, this layer was divided into three analysis regions (Boreal and Foothills, Prairie, and Rocky Mountain. The Lotic Riparian Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a provincial scale GIS layer that delineates riparian areas adjacent to streams, rivers, wetlands, and lakes. This layer was used to improve the delineation of aquatic habitat not captured by the ABMI Wetland Inventory. The Human Footprint Inventory is a provincial scale GIS layer that consolidates 115 types of anthropogenic disturbance into 20 subcategories. This layer allowed us to determine the loss of native habitat due to anthropogenic disturbance. Hierarchical Watershed Boundaries of Alberta The Hydrologic Unit Code Watersheds of Alberta layer allows us to aggregate the status of AWNC and TNC based on ecologically relevant boundaries (Hydrologic Unit Code Watersheds of Alberta). We chose to aggregate the information at the HUC-8 watershed scale. Each HUC-8 watershed contains both AWNC and TNC, with TNC ranging between 3.5% to 94% across watersheds. However, these indicators can be reported at alternative spatial scales. 3.2 Reference condition The Native Cover indicator is expressed as a percentage based on a reference state. We defined the reference state as if there is a complete absence of human footprint. Under this reference condition, Alberta is composed of 66% TNC and 34% AWNC. By using this reference state, it can aid the interpretation of changes in native cover over time. Areas defined as aquatic and wetland native cover are based on when the source layers were derived. Areas which are now considered upland may have contained wetlands prior to anthropogenic disturbance and this loss is not reflected in this indicator. Areas identified as aquatic and wetland (blue) and terrestrial (yellow) native cover based on the ABMI Wetland Inventory and Lotic Riparian layer. 3.3 Recovery of forest harvest areas Applying recovery to harvest areas when calculating current conditions gives a more realistic representation of how harvest areas interact with the surrounding ecosystem. It is well known in the scientific literature that forest harvesting, particularly clearcut harvesting, differs from wildfire in their impacts on biodiversity McRae et al. (2001). Although harvest areas provide habitat for some species, they are not equivalent to post-fire forest stands of the same age. However, forest harvest areas do recover over time, and recovery curves recommended by Huggard and Kremsater (2015) for deciduous and coniferous forest types were applied when calculating the conditions of the AWNC and TNC indicators. These recovery curves were simplified to a single recovery curve to allow the AWNC and TNC indicators to be calculated using only publicly available GIS layers. Forest recovery curves as described by Kremsater et al., 2015 3.4 Indicator Conditions 3.4.1 Aquatic Native Cover For each HUC-8 watershed, we calculated the area of aquatic native cover (ABMI Wetland Inventory and Lotic Riparian DEM) under both reference condition (no human footprint) and current condition (erase native habitat under human footprint) across five time periods (2010, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021). \\(Aquatic Native Cover = \\frac{Current Aquatic Cover}{Reference Aquatic Cover} * 100\\%\\) 3.4.2 Terrestrial Native Cover Terrestrial native cover is calculated from the inverse of the ABMI wetland Inventory and Lotic Riparian DEM (i.e., any habitat not identified as a wetland is therefore an upland habitat). For each HUC-8 watershed, we calculated the area of terrestiral native cover under both reference condition (no human footprint) and current condition (erase native habitat under human footprint) across five time periods (2010, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021). \\(Terrestrial Native Cover = \\frac{Current Terrestrial Cover}{Reference Terrestrial Cover} * 100\\%\\) References "],["measuring-native-cover.html", "4 Measuring Native Cover 4.1 Aquatic Native Cover 4.2 Terrestrial Native Cover 4.3 Limitations and Future Improvements", " 4 Measuring Native Cover 4.1 Aquatic Native Cover Across all HUC-8 watersheds, AWNC values ranged from 10.6% to 100%, with provincial average values of 79.7%, 79.0%, 78.8%, 78.7% and 78.6% respectively, for 2010, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. AWNC was high in northern Alberta and the Rocky Mountains for all five time steps, as indicated by higher indicator values. On the other hand, lower amounts of AWNC were detected in more developed areas such as the southern part of the province. Status of AWNC in 2010 (top left), 2018 (top centre), 2019 (top right), 2020 (bottom left), and 2021 (bottom centre). AWNC conditions declined from 2010 to 2021 for most watersheds, with an average decline of 1.1% (SD = 1.24) across all watersheds in the province. Of the 422 HUC-8 watersheds, AWNC increased in 28 watersheds, decreased in 389 watersheds, and was stable in 5 watersheds. For the 28 watersheds that observed increases, only 2 had increases greater than 0.5%, while 21 had increases smaller than 0.1%. Of the 389 watersheds experiencing declines, 79 watersheds experienced declines greater than 2%. For one watershed (HUC 18050404), indicator condition declined 11.6% over the 11-year period, from 79.2% to 67.6%. Percent change in AWNC between 2010 and 2021. 4.2 Terrestrial Native Cover Across all HUC-8 watersheds, TNC values ranged from 3.9% to 100%, with provincial average values of 69.0%, 67.6%, 67.2%, 67.0% and 66.8% respectively, for 2010, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. Similar trends to AWNC conditions were observed for TNC conditions. TNC was high in northern Alberta and the Rocky Mountains, with lower amounts of TNC detected in more developed areas. Status of TNC in 2010 (top left), 2018 (top centre), 2019 (top right), 2020 (bottom left), and 2021 (bottom centre). Across the province, TNC decreased by an average of 2.15% (SD = 2.69) from 2010 to 2021. Of the 422 HUC-8 watersheds, TNC increased in 34 watersheds, decreased in 383, and was stable in 5 watersheds. For the 34 watersheds that observed increases, only 6 had increases greater than 0.5%, while 21 had increases smaller than 0.1%. Of the 383 watersheds experiencing declines, TNC decreased more than 2% in 154 watersheds, more than 5% in 56 watersheds, and more than 10% in 13 watersheds. For one watershed (HUC 18050101), indicator condition declined 13.9% over the 11-year period, from 78.1% to 64.2%. Percent change in AWNC between 2010 and 2021. 4.3 Limitations and Future Improvements All indicators, as representations of a component of the environment, have limitations. A single indicator cannot measure all aspects of habitat quantity and quality. The Native Cover indicator is intended to serve as a general indicator of habitat quantity at the regional and sub-regional levels. Currently, clearcut harvest areas are the only type of footprint that is allowed to recover in the calculation of AWNC and TNC. Recovery for other footprint types (e.g., seismic lines, wellpads) will not be accounted for until sufficient supporting information becomes available. Potential future improvements include: • incorporating recovery for other human footprint types and refining the recovery curves for forest harvest areas, • attributing changes in AWNC and TNC to relevant reporting sectors, and • acquiring new wetland inventories that better represent wetland loss over time.
